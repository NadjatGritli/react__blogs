I'm looking to have a React website developed specifically for wedding resources. This website will primarily have two main features:

- A wedding planning checklist: This needs to be dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly, allowing users to track their wedding planning progress.
- A vendor directory: This should include a search function along with detailed profiles of various wedding vendors.

As for the design and color scheme, I'm open to any creative ideas. While I do want the web UI to have a wedding vibe - elegant and romantic, I'm more interested in functionality and user experience.

Ideal freelancers for this project are those who have significant experience in React.js together with a skill for crafting visually stunning yet functional web UI. Experience in developing similar wedding or event planning websites would be an added bonus.
